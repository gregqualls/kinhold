## 2026-03-19 — Session 6: Tag-Based Task Filtering (Replace Task Lists)

### What Was Done
- **Replaced task list navigation with tag-based filtering** — tasks now live in a single flat view with colored tag chips for filtering instead of navigating between separate lists.

- **Database:**
  - New `tags` table (uuid, family_id, name, color, sort_order)
  - New `task_tag` pivot table (many-to-many: tasks can have multiple tags)
  - Migration to convert existing task lists into tags and link tasks to their corresponding tags
  - Made `task_list_id` nullable on tasks table

- **Backend:**
  - New `Tag` model with `belongsToMany(Task)` relationship
  - New `TagController` with full CRUD (index with task counts, store, update, destroy)
  - New `TagResource` for API responses
  - Added `tags()` relationship to `Task` model
  - Updated `TaskController`: tag-based filtering via `tags` query param, `tag_ids` sync on create/update, tasks no longer require a task_list_id
  - Updated `TaskResource` to include tags array
  - Updated form requests: `task_list_id` now optional, added `tag_ids` validation
  - Added `POST /tasks` route for creating tasks without going through a task list
  - Added tag CRUD routes: `GET/POST /tags`, `PUT/DELETE /tags/{tag}`

- **Frontend — New `TasksView.vue`:**
  - Single flat view showing all tasks (replaces both `TaskListsView` and `TaskListDetailView`)
  - Horizontal scrollable tag bar with colored chips — click to filter, "All" selected by default
  - Tag manager modal (gear icon): create, rename, delete tags with color picker
  - Quick add with tag selector
  - Collapsible completed tasks section
  - Inline editing + slide panel for full details

- **Frontend — Updated Components:**
  - `TaskItem`: colored tag chips on each task, inline title editing (double-click), click priority flag to cycle priority, points display
  - `TaskQuickAdd`: tag chip toggles for assigning tags during creation
  - `TaskDetailPanel`: multi-select tag chips, uses `assigned_to`/`assignee` properly
  - `TopBar`: updated route name mapping (Tasks instead of TaskLists/TaskListDetail)
  - `DashboardView`: uses `completed_at` instead of `completed`, removed `fetchTaskLists` call

- **Pinia Store (`tasks.js`):**
  - Full rewrite: tags state, selectedTagIds, filteredTasks computed
  - Tag CRUD actions: fetchTags, createTag, updateTag, deleteTag
  - toggleTagFilter/clearTagFilter for UI filtering
  - Simplified task fetching (single `/tasks` endpoint, no list ID required)
  - Uses `completed_at` consistently instead of `completed` boolean

- **Seeder:** creates tags (General, Chores, School) instead of task lists, attaches tags to demo tasks

### Architecture Decisions
- **Tags replace lists** — tasks can have multiple tags (many-to-many pivot), enabling more flexible organization
- **Backward compatible** — `task_list_id` column kept (nullable) and TaskList model/controller preserved, but no longer used by the frontend
- **Client-side filtering** — tag filtering happens in the Pinia store (computed), not via API calls, for instant responsiveness. API supports server-side tag filtering too via `?tags=id1,id2`

### Build Status
- 790 Vue/JS modules, 0 errors via `npx vite build`
- All PHP files pass syntax check

### Next Session TODO
- Test the full flow end-to-end in browser (create tag, create task with tags, filter, inline edit, complete)
- Consider removing TaskList model/controller/routes once tag system is proven stable
- Dark mode toggle in TopBar (still pending)
- Continue gamification flow testing

## 2026-03-17 — Session 5: Gamification System (Points, Rewards, Badges)

### What Was Done
- **Full gamification system implemented** across ~50 new/modified files covering backend, frontend, and integration.

- **Backend — Migrations (6 new):**
  - `add_recurrence_to_tasks_table` — points, recurrence_rule, recurrence_end, parent_task_id
  - `create_point_transactions_table` — ledger-based points system with polymorphic source
  - `create_rewards_table` — parent-created prizes purchasable with points
  - `create_reward_purchases_table` — purchase history
  - `create_badges_table` — Steam-style achievements with trigger types
  - `create_user_badges_table` — pivot with earned_at and awarded_by

- **Backend — Enums (2 new):**
  - `PointTransactionType` — task_completion, task_reversal, kudos, deduction, redemption, adjustment
  - `BadgeTriggerType` — points_earned, tasks_completed, task_streak, kudos_received/given, rewards_purchased, login_streak, custom

- **Backend — Models (4 new, 3 updated):**
  - New: PointTransaction, Reward, RewardPurchase, Badge
  - Updated: Task (points, recurrence, getEffectivePoints), User (pointBank, badges), Family (leaderboard period, enabled modules)

- **Backend — Services (2 new):**
  - `PointsService` — award/reverse task points, kudos, deductions, reward redemption, leaderboard with period-scoped rankings
  - `BadgeService` — auto-checks badge thresholds after events, manual award/revoke, streak calculations

- **Backend — Controllers (3 new, 1 updated):**
  - New: PointsController (bank, leaderboard, feed, kudos, deduct), RewardsController (CRUD + purchase), BadgesController (CRUD + award/revoke + progress)
  - Updated: TaskController — awards points on complete, reverses on uncomplete, checks badges

- **Backend — Recurring Tasks:**
  - `GenerateRecurringTasks` artisan command — parses RRULE (DAILY, WEEKLY+BYDAY, MONTHLY+BYMONTHDAY), generates 7 days ahead
  - Scheduled daily at 00:05 via Kernel

- **Backend — Feature Toggles:**
  - SettingsController accepts enabled_modules + leaderboard_period
  - Stored in families.settings JSON column

- **Frontend — Pinia Stores (2 new, 1 updated):**
  - `stores/points.js` — bank, leaderboard, feed, rewards, purchases with all CRUD actions
  - `stores/badges.js` — badges, earned badges with CRUD + award/revoke
  - `stores/auth.js` — added enabledModules and isModuleEnabled computed

- **Frontend — Points Views & Components (3 views, 6 components):**
  - PointsFeedView — balance card, leaderboard strip, scrollable activity feed, kudos input, deduct modal
  - RewardsView — reward grid with purchase flow, parent CRUD
  - PointsHistoryView — personal transaction history
  - Components: LeaderboardStrip, FeedItem, KudosInput, DeductModal, RewardCard, TaskPointsBadge

- **Frontend — Badges Views & Components (1 view, 5 components):**
  - BadgesView — All/Earned/Locked tabs, create badge form, icon picker, manual award
  - Components: BadgeIcon (hexagonal SVG), BadgeCard, BadgeShowcase, BadgeProgressBar, badgeIcons.js (20 SVG paths)

- **Frontend — Integration:**
  - Sidebar + BottomNav — Points and Badges nav items, filtered by enabled modules
  - TopBar — page titles for all new views
  - DashboardView — Points balance card + LeaderboardStrip, Badges showcase
  - Router — /points, /points/rewards, /points/history, /badges with module guards
  - SettingsView — module toggles for points/badges, leaderboard period selector

- **Seeder — Demo Data:**
  - 5 rewards (Sweets 10pts, TV Time 20pts, Pick Dinner 30pts, Movie Pick 40pts, Stay Up Late 75pts)
  - Tasks with point values + recurring "Take out trash" every Tuesday
  - 7 point transactions (Demo Child has 45 pts in bank)
  - 11 badges (10 preset + 1 custom "Welcome"), 2 earned by Demo Child
  - Family settings with all modules enabled + weekly leaderboard

### Architecture Decisions
- **Ledger pattern** for points: Point Bank = SUM(all transactions), Leaderboard = SUM(positive in current period). Never mutate a running balance — always append transactions.
- **Instant purchases** — no approval flow for rewards. Points deducted immediately.
- **Hidden badges** show as "???" until earned — fun surprise mechanic for kids.
- **Feature toggles** stored in family settings JSON, enforced at nav/router/API level.

### Build Status
- 791 Vue/JS modules, 0 errors via `npx vite build`
- All 17 migrations run successfully
- Seeder creates full demo data (verified: 2 users, 5 tasks, 5 rewards, 11 badges, 7 transactions, 2 earned badges, child bank = 45 pts)

### Next Session TODO
- Dark mode toggle in TopBar (still pending from Session 4)
- Test the full flow end-to-end in browser (complete task → points awarded → badge earned → toast)
- Test recurring task generation: `php artisan app:generate-recurring-tasks`
- Test feature toggles: disable points/badges → verify nav/routes hidden

## 2026-03-17 — Session 4: Dark Mode & CSS Architecture Fix

### What Was Done
- **Fixed dark mode CSS architecture:**
  - Root cause: global dark mode overrides in `app.css` were outside `@layer`, making them always beat Tailwind's `dark:` utilities (which live inside `@layer utilities`). This meant all explicit `dark:` classes were being silently ignored.
  - Moved dark mode overrides into `@layer components` so they serve as defaults that Tailwind's `dark:` utilities can properly override.
  - Removed blunt global overrides (`.dark .bg-white`, `.dark .text-prussian-500`, `.dark .bg-lavender-50`, `.dark .border-lavender-200`, etc.) that were masking everything.
  - Kept component-level dark overrides (`.dark .card`, `.dark .input-base`, `.dark .btn-secondary`, `.dark .btn-ghost`, `.dark .divider`) as sensible defaults in `@layer components`.

- **Added dark mode variants to SettingsView.vue:**
  - All 6 section headings now have `dark:text-lavender-200`
  - All labels, descriptions, helper text have `dark:text-lavender-300` or `dark:text-lavender-400`
  - All list items (`bg-lavender-50`) have `dark:bg-prussian-700`
  - All borders have `dark:border-prussian-700`
  - Error/info banners have dark variants (`dark:bg-red-900/20`, `dark:bg-blue-900/20`)

- **Improved task save button UX (TaskDetailPanel.vue):**
  - Added dirty state tracking (`isDirty` computed) that compares form values against original snapshot
  - "Unsaved changes" label (gold text) appears when any field is modified
  - Save button gets subtle glow + scale-up when dirty to draw attention
  - "Saved!" confirmation with green checkmark flashes for 2 seconds after saving
  - Fixed invalid Tailwind class `dark:bg-prussian-700.5` (appeared on date and select inputs)

- **Added calendar source labels (CalendarView.vue):**
  - Added `calendarNameMap` computed and `getCalendarSourceName()` helper
  - Month view: tooltip on event chips shows calendar source
  - Week view: small text line under each event shows source name
  - Day view: colored dot + label shows calendar source

- **Dark mode fixes across remaining components:**
  - DashboardView: Quick Actions heading, task text, completed task styles
  - TaskItem: due date classes returned from JS now include `dark:` variants
  - TopBar: avatar ring color (`dark:ring-prussian-800`)

- **Discovered stale Vite dev server issue:**
  - The Vite dev server had been running since session start, consuming 2245 min CPU, and was NOT generating custom color Tailwind utilities
  - Restarting it fixed CSS generation — all `dark:bg-prussian-*`, `dark:text-lavender-*` etc. now properly generated
  - Important: if dark mode appears broken, restart the Vite dev server first (`kill` the old process, then `npm run dev`)

### Build Status
- 774 Vue/JS modules, 0 errors via `npx vite build`
- Dark mode verified working in browser — cards, headings, borders, inputs all correct
- Light mode verified still working correctly

### Next Session TODO
- **Add dark mode toggle to TopBar** (desktop) and mobile header — currently only accessible via Settings > Appearance
- **Update ROADMAP.md** — Dark mode status should change from DEFERRED to IN PROGRESS/COMPLETE
- Continue with Phase 3 (Calendar) or Phase 5 (Dashboard) from the UI/UX overhaul plan

- **Phase 6 — Chat (Polish):**
  - Rewrite of `ChatView.vue` — Message bubbles (user=right/blue, AI=left/gray), animated typing indicator (bouncing dots), suggested question cards, fixed bottom input bar

- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Fixed auth `isLoading` overlay staying visible during background `fetchUser()` calls
  - Fixed `createTask` using wrong API endpoint (`POST /tasks` → `POST /task-lists/{id}/tasks`)
  - Fixed `toggleComplete` using wrong endpoint (`/toggle-complete` → `/complete` or `/uncomplete`)
  - Fixed `fetchTasks` not loading `taskLists` when navigating directly to a task list detail page
  - Fixed `currentList` not resolving when `taskLists` array was empty on direct navigation

### Build Status
- 772 Vue/JS modules, 0 errors via `npx vite build`
- All pages verified in browser (mobile + desktop viewports)
- Task CRUD fully functional: create, edit, complete, delete tasks and task lists

## 2026-03-16 — Session 1: Project Scaffolding

### What Was Done
- **Project kickoff:** 5 rounds of design questions to nail down MVP scope, tech stack, and architecture
- **Full project scaffolding:** 146 files across backend, frontend, MCP server, and infrastructure
- **Backend (Laravel 11):**
  - 9 Eloquent models with full relationships (User, Family, Task, TaskList, VaultEntry, VaultCategory, VaultPermission, Document, CalendarConnection)
  - 3 backed enums (FamilyRole, TaskPriority, PermissionLevel)
  - 10 database migrations with proper foreign keys and indexes
  - 9 API controllers with CRUD operations
  - 6 form request validators
  - 8 API resource transformers
  - 4 authorization policies
  - 3 service classes (GoogleCalendar, VaultEncryption, Chatbot)
  - 2 database seeders (vault categories + demo family)
  - Full route configuration with Sanctum middleware
- **Frontend (Vue 3 SPA):**
  - 5 Pinia stores (auth, tasks, vault, calendar, chat)
  - Vue Router with auth guards (guest, authenticated, parent-only)
  - 7 common components (BaseCard, BaseButton, BaseModal, BaseInput, UserAvatar, EmptyState, LoadingSpinner)
  - 3 layout components (BottomNav, Sidebar, TopBar)
  - 9 page views (Login, Register, Dashboard, Calendar, TaskLists, TaskDetail, VaultCategories, VaultEntries, VaultEntry, Chat, Settings)
  - Module-specific components for calendar, tasks, vault, and chat
  - API service with Axios (CSRF, auth, error handling)
  - 2 composables (useNotification, useFamilyColors)
  - Tailwind CSS with custom warm color palette
- **MCP Server:**
  - TypeScript with @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
  - 26 tools across 5 categories (tasks, calendar, vault, family, chat)
  - API client with Sanctum token auth
- **Infrastructure:**
  - Docker Compose with app, nginx, PostgreSQL, Redis, node services
  - Multi-stage Dockerfile
  - Nginx configuration
  - Upsun deployment config (`.upsun/config.yaml`)
  - Setup script (`setup.sh`)
- **Documentation:**
  - CLAUDE.md (project context for future sessions)
  - docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (technical decisions with reasoning)
  - docs/ROADMAP.md (4-phase feature plan)
  - docs/CONVENTIONS.md (coding standards)
  - CHANGELOG.md (this file)
  - README.md (open-source project readme)
  - MIT LICENSE

### Decisions Made
- Laravel 11 REST API + Vue 3 SPA (not Livewire/Inertia)
- PostgreSQL over MySQL (better JSON, full-text search)
- App-level encryption for vault (not per-user or zero-knowledge — enables chatbot)
- Hybrid vault permissions (parent/child roles + per-item overrides)
- MCP server in TypeScript (better SDK support)
- Mobile-first card-based UI with bottom navigation
- Cookie auth for SPA, token auth for MCP
- Open source: MIT license, Docker + self-hosted deployment

### Bug Fixes Applied (same session)
- Fixed CSS import path in app.js (`@/css/app.css` → `../css/app.css`)
- Fixed `creator_id` → `created_by` in TaskController, TaskListController, VaultController, TaskPolicy
- Fixed AuthController to use direct `family_id` assignment instead of non-existent pivot table
- Added `currentFamily()` query builder method to User model
- Created missing ChatMessage model + migration
- Fixed ChatbotService to use HTTP client instead of non-existent Anthropic PHP SDK
- Removed non-existent CalendarEvent model reference from ChatbotService
- Added `invite_code` column to families migration and Family model fillable
- Fixed CalendarController field names (`color_code` → `color`, removed `calendar_email`)
- Fixed Document creation in VaultController to use polymorphic fields correctly
- Fixed Dockerfile (`vite.config.ts` → `vite.config.js`, added `php` stage name, added `icu-dev`)
- Improved setup.sh with better error handling and Docker Compose v2 support
- Simplified entrypoint.sh (removed non-existent artisan commands)
- Frontend builds clean: 431 modules, 0 errors

### Known Issues / Next Steps
- [ ] Need Docker on local machine to boot (`chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh`)
- [ ] Google Calendar OAuth needs real credentials from Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Chatbot needs Anthropic API key in `.env`
- [ ] Route conflict possible: `/vault/entry/:id` vs `/vault/:categorySlug` — needs runtime testing
- [ ] Some Vue components reference `@heroicons/vue` which may need icon adjustments
- [ ] `CalendarEventResource` receives arrays not models — may need adjustment
- [ ] Vault encryption service needs testing with actual encrypted data round-trips
